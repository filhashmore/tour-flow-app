/**
 * Element Selection Module (Web)
 *
 * Enables visual element selection within the iframe. When the parent sends
 * 'vibecode:select:start', this component activates selection mode:
 *
 * - Hovering an element highlights it (blue outline)
 * - Clicking an element locks it as selected (green outline) and notifies parent
 * - Cmd/Ctrl + click for multi-select
 * - Parent confirms via 'vibecode:select:confirm' to finalize
 * - Parent can cancel via 'vibecode:select:cancel'
 *
 * Only one selection session can be active at a time.
 * All event listeners use capture phase to intercept before the app.
