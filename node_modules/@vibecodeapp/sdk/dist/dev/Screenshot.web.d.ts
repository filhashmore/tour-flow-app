/**
 * Web version of Screenshot - listens for screenshot requests from parent iframe
 *
 * On web, this component listens for postMessage requests and captures
 * the current page using html-to-image (Chromium) or html2canvas (Safari/Firefox),
 * then sends the result back.
 * html-to-image is faster than html2canvas, but html2canvas is more reliable on Safari/Firefox.
 * due to the fact that html-to-image uses foreignObjects.
